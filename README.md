# Calculator Web App

## Overview
This project is a simple and functional calculator web application. It is built using React.js, HTML, and CSS, and allows users to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project serves as an excellent side project for practicing state management, event handling, and component design in React.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Styling:** Custom CSS
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality:** Allows users to reset the calculator input.
- **Decimal Support:** Handles floating-point numbers in calculations.
- **Interactive Buttons:** Responsive UI with clickable buttons for digits and operations.
- **Display:** Shows the current input or result of the calculations.

## Learning Goals
- **State Management:** Utilize React's `useState` hook to manage the input, operator, and result states.
- **Event Handling:** Implement click and keyboard event handling to capture user interactions.
- **Mathematical Logic:** Implement the core logic for handling arithmetic operations and updating the display.
  
## Pages Design
The web application has a simple and clean interface:
1. **Calculator Display:** Shows the current input or result of the operation.
2. **Calculator Buttons:** Includes digits (0-9), basic operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions like decimal point and clear (`C`).

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains all React components.
  - `App.js`: Main component that renders the calculator.
  - `App.css`: Styling for the calculator layout and buttons.
- `public/`: Static files like HTML and favicon.
- `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
  
## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Mathematical Operations:** Add support for operations like percentages, square roots, and exponentiation.
- **History Feature:** Implement a history log to show previous calculations.
- **Keyboard Support:** Allow users to perform calculations using the keyboard.
  
## Conclusion
This Calculator Web App demonstrates how to build a basic but interactive web application using React.js. It provides an excellent starting point for more complex projects and showcases key concepts such as state management, event handling, and modular component design in React.
